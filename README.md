# TwisterTempo
*TwisterTempo* is a Python game involving a specific mat, 
like the ones you can find in other, physical, games 
(see https://www.google.com/search?q=twister+mat).

The game will listen to you favourite music through the built-in audio 
input of your PC and then show in real time on the screen your moves to be performed on the mat.
The moves depend on the tempo of the music, so it is a sort of rhythm game...

## Requirements
The game has been tested on Linux, Mac OS and Windows platforms. 
You will need a PC/Laptop with a microphone (built-in or external),
and your favourite music from an external source (TV, Amazon Echo, Google Nest, whatever)

As for the software you will need Python 3.5+, and the following libraries installed 
(all available on PyPI):
* Pyglet
* NumPy
* Sounddevice
* Aubio

## Contacts
At the moment the project is maintained by me, alone. 
My daughter and her MacBook Air perform the real-life tests.
So please write me for any question:
